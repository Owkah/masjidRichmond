<h4><strong>100 Hadith Qudsi</strong></h4>

<h6><strong>One whose intention is not pure will deserve Hell in the Hereafter.
  Purity of intention is essential in all deeds.</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (pbuh) saying: The first of the people whose
  case will be decided on the Day of Judgment will be a man who died as a martyr. He will be brought forth. Allah
  will make him know about His blessings (which He had bestowed on him in the World). The man will acknowledge them.
  Then Allah will ask him: What did you do with them? He will say: I fought in Your way until I died as a martyr.
  Allah will remark: You are lying. You fought so that you may be called a brave warrior. Then orders will be
  passed against him. So he will be dragged along on his face and cast into Hell.</p>
<p>Second will be a man who studied (religious) knowledge. Then he taught it to others and recited the Qur'an.
    He will be brought (for Judgment). Allah will remind him of His favors (showered on him in the world).
    He will admit them (having enjoyed them in his life). Then Allah will ask him: What did you do with them?
    He will reply: I acquired knowledge and imparted it and also recited the Qur'an for Your sake. Allah will observe:
    You have told a lie, for you got knowledge to be renowned as a scholar; and you recited the Qur'an to be
    marked as a Qari (one who recites the Qur'an according to the rules). Then orders will be passed against him.
    So he will be dragged along on his face and thrown into Hell.</p>
<p>Third will be a man to whom Allah had made abundantly rich and granted him every kind of wealth. He will be
  brought for judgment. Allah will let him know about His gifts conferred upon him in the world. He will recognize
  them. Then Allah will inquire: What did you with them? He will say: I left no way in which you like money to be
  spent without spending in it for your sake. Allah will say: You are lying. You did so to be described as generous
   (in the society); (It means you got your reward in the world according to your intention). Now you deserve nothing
   in the Hereafter except Hell). So orders will be passed against him and he will be dragged along on his face until
    he will be hurled into Hell. (This Hadith is sound and related by Muslim and An-Nasa'i)</p>

<h6><strong>Warning against hypocrisy (show off)</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> Narrated Mahmoud Ibn Lubaid: Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said: The most dreadful thing which
 I fear about you is minor polytheism. The companions asked: What is the minor polytheism? He said: It is
 hypocrisy; and he added that on the Day of Judgment, when rewarding people for their deeds, Allah (sw) will say
  to the hypocrites: Go to those for the sake of whom you used to perform good deeds; and see whether you can get
  any reward from them.(This Hadith is sound and mentioned in Musnad of Ahmad)</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said: Allah (sw) said: Among all partners,
  I am the most dispensable with association. So anyone who performs a deed in which he ascribes to Me others;
  I will abandon him and his act of polytheism. (This Hadith is sound and related by Muslim).</p>


<h6><strong>Hazardship of shirk (joining partners with Allah)</strong><h6>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira that the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: On the Day of Resurrection,
Ibrahim (Abraham) will see his father Azar (in such a pitiable condition) that his face will be dark and
covered with dust. Then Ibrahim will remind him: Did I not warn you against denying me? His father will reply:
Today I will not deny you. Then, Ibrahim will say: O Lord! You have promised not to disgrace me on the Day of
Resurrection. So what will be more disgraceful to me than my wretched father. Allah will say: I have forbidden
Paradise for disbelievers. Then it will be said: O Ibrahim, Look! what is underneath your feet? He will look
and see his father as a Hyena -besmeared with dirt caught by the legs and thrown into Hell.</p>

<p><strong>(5)</strong> Narrated Anas bin Malik on the authority of the Prophet (pbuh), who said: Allah (sw) will
say to the least tormented person among the people of Hell on the Day of Resurrection: Do you have any thing on
earth, that you would give as a ransom (to protect yourself against the torment of Fire)? He will say: Yes.
Then Allah will say: While you were in the backbone of Adam, I had demanded you much less than that, i.e.
to associate nothing with Me; but you declined and worshipped others besides Me.(This Hadith is sound and related
by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</p>

<h6><strong>Superiority of Monotheism</strong><h6>
<p><strong>(6)</strong> Narrated Abu Dhar: Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said, Allah (sw) said: He who comes with a good deed, its reward
 will be ten like that or even more. And he who comes with vice, his reward will be only one like that, or I can
  forgive him. He who draws close to Me a hand's span, I will draw close to him an arm's length. And whoever draws
  near Me an arm's length, I will draw near him a fathom's length. And whoever comes to Me walking, I will go to
   him running. And whoever faces Me with sins nearly as great as the earth, I will meet him with forgiveness nearly
    as great as that, provided he does not worship something with me.
(This Hadith is sound and related by Muslim, Ibn Majah and Ahmad in his Musnad).</p>

<p><strong>(7)</strong> Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri: Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said: None of you will have argued
  for his right in the world more vehemently than the believers who will do with their Lord about their brethren
  who were admitted into Hell. The Prophet (pbuh) added: They will say: O Lord! Our brethren used to offer prayers
  with us, observe fast with us and perform pilgrimage (Hajj) with us. But You cast them into fire. The Prophet
  (pbuh) further said: Allah will say: Go and bring out whoever you know from among them. The Prophet (pbuh) said:
  The believers will come to them and recognize them by face. Some of them will be those the fire would have seized
  up to half of their shanks and some of them up to their ankles. They will bring them and say: O Lord! We have
  taken out those for whom you gave us order. Then the Prophet (pbuh) said: Allah will say: Bring out whoever has
  in his heart any belief weighing a Dinar (a coin). Then He will say: Take out whoever has in his heart the belief
  weighing half a Dinar until He will say: Take out whoever has in his heart the belief that equals the weight
  of an atom.(This Hadith is sound and related by An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah).</p>
  <p>After narrating this Hadith, Abu Sa'id said: He who does not accept it as true should read this verse:
  "Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives except that
  (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented
  a tremendous sin." (V.4:48)</p>

<h6><strong>Superiority of the believers in the Oneness of Allah and the punishment of Jews and Christians</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(8)</strong> Narrated Abu Musa: Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said: On the Day of Resurrection, my Ummah (nation)
  will be gathered into three groups. one sort will enter Paradise without rendering an account (of their deeds).
  another sort will be reckoned an easy account and admitted into Paradise. yet another sort will come bearing on
  their backs heaps of sins like great mountains. Allah will ask the angels though He knows best about them:
  Who are these people? They will reply: They are humble slaves of yours. He will say: Unload the sins from them
  and put the same over the Jews and Christians; then let the humble slaves get into Paradise by virtue of My Mercy.
  (This Hadith is sound and mentioned in Mustadrak of Al-Hakim.)</p>

<h6><strong>Superiority of those who neither treat with amulet, nor get themselves branded nor take omens
  (but instead trust their Lord)</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(9)</strong> Narrated Ibn Mas'ud that the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: On the Day of Resurrection nations
   will be brought. When I see my nation (Ummah) I will be amazed at their multitudes and (distinguished) form.
   They will have filled up the plain lands as well as the mountains. Allah will ask me: Are you satisfied?
   I will say: Yes, O my Lord: He will say: Along with these (people), seventy thousand persons (i.e., so many)
   will enter Paradise without rendering an account. They will be those who neither cure themselves with
   Ruqya (recitations) nor get themselves branded (cauterized), nor take omens but they instead repose trust in
   their Lord. Upon this, 'Ukkasha said:Supplicate Allah (sw)that He makes me one among them), the Prophet
   (pbuh) said: O Allah! Make him one of them. Another person said: Invoke a blessing for me too
   (that Allah makes me one among them). The Prophet (pbuh) said: 'Ukkasha has preceded you in this matter.
    (This Hadith is sound and related by Ibn Hibban)</p>

<h6><strong>Superiority of the words (There is no god but Allah)</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(10)</strong> Narrated by 'Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-'Aas that Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said: On the Day
  of Resurrection, Allah will bring a person of my Ummah from among the people; and spread before him ninety nine
  registers (filled up with his deeds). Each of them will be as long as sight extends. Then Allah will ask him:
  Do you deny anything of it? Have my preserving writers treated you unjustly? The person will reply: No, my
  Lord. Allah will further ask him: Do you have any excuse (for not having good deeds)? He will say: No, my
  Lord. Then Allah will observe: Behold! We have preserved a virtue of yours with us. Today there will be
  no wrong with you. Then Allah will take out a slip containing the words: "There is no god but Allah and
  that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger."; and Allah will address the person: Bring up your weights
  (of this slip). The person will remark: O Lord! This slip (is so light in weight) that it may not be matched
  with these large registers. Allah will observe: you will be done no injustice The Prophet added: All the
  registers will be piled up in one scale and the slip will be kept in the other scale of the balance.
  (With the Grace of Allah), the scale with the registers will be raised up (due to light weight) while the
  scale having the slip will be the heavier as there is nothing that weighs more than the name of Allah.
(This Hadith is sound and related by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ahmad in his Musnad.)</p>

<h6><strong>Statement of Allah (sw), (whether you disclose that which is in your minds or conceal,
  Allah will reckon you accordingly)</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(11)</strong> Ibn 'Abbas said: When this verse was revealed: (Whether you disclose
  what is in your minds or conceal it, Allah will call you to account according to it) it caused anxiety to
  the companions as had never been before. Then Allah's Messenger (pbuh) observed: Say: We have heard
  and obeyed and submitted (to The Lord!). The narrator added: Allah instilled faith in their hearts
  and further revealed (for their satisfaction) this verse: (Allah burdens not a soul beyond its capacity.
  It will get every good that it earns and it will suffer every ill that it commits. Our Lord! Call us not
  to account if we forget or make a mistake. (When they said the same verse) Allah said: I have done.
  They further said: Our Lord! Lay not upon us a burden as your did lay on those before us. Allah said:
  I have done so The companions further said. And pardon us, have Mercy on us . your are our protector.
  The Lord said: one.(This Hadith is sound and related by Al-Bukhari and At-Tirmidhi)</p>

<p><strong>(12)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira: When this verse was revealed to Allah's Messenger (pbuh):
  (To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and whether you disclose what
   is in your minds or conceal it, Allah will reckon you according to it. Then He will forgive whom He pleases
    and chastise whom He likes as Allah is Al-Omnipotent over every thing). The narrator said: The companions
    of Allah's Messenger (pbuh) felt it hard. They came to him, sat down on their knees and said: O Messenger
    of Allah, we have been assigned with some duties (tasks)</p>

<h6><strong>Broadness of Allah's Mercy</strong><h6>
<p><strong>(13)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira that the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) who said: Allah (sw) said: My mercy has preceded (excelled) my wrath.
(This Hadith is sound and related by Muslim).</p>

<h6><strong>An example of Allah's Mercy on his servants</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(14)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira that Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said: Allah says: Whenever My slave intends
  to do a bad deed, (I say to the deeds recording angels): Do not record it against him until he (actually) commits
  it. If he has done so, write it down exactly as one in his record book. But if he refrains from it for My sake,
  write down this as a virtue in his favor. And when he intends to do a good deed, but does not actually do it, write
  it as a virtue for him. And if he puts it into practice, write its reward equal to, from ten to seven hundred
  times (in his account).(This Hadith is sound and related by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and At-Tirmidhi).</p>

<h6><strong>Warning to those who loose hope in the Mercy of Allah</strong></h6>
<p>(15) Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (pbuh) saying: There were two fraternal persons among
  the sons of Israel. One of them was engrossed in committing sins while the other was devoted to worship.
  The devotee used to see his fellow committing sin and advise him. Desist from doing so. One day when he found
  his fellow committing sin. He said to him: Avoid it. His fellow said: Leave me alone. Have you been sent out
  as a vigilant on me. The devotee said: By Allah, He will neither forgive you nor admit you to Paradise.
  When they died, they were gathered before the Lord of the Worlds. Allah asked the devotee: Were you assured
  of knowing Me or were you having power over what was in My Hands? Then He said to the sinner:
  Go and enter Paradise by My Mercy; and ordered the angels about the devotee: Lead him to the Hell. (This Hadith
  is sound and related by Abu Da'ud in his Sunan) After narrating the Hadith, Abu Huraira commented: By Him in
  whose hands my soul is: One word spoken by the devotee ruined his good deeds in the World as well as in the
  Hereafter.</p>

<p><strong>(16)</strong> Narrated Jundub that Allah's Messenger (pbuh) stated that a person said:
  By Allah! Allah will not forgive so and so (person). Thereupon Allah, the Exalted remarked:
  Who is he who swears by Me (and says) that I will not forgive so and so (listen!) Verily I have forgiven so
  and so and nullified your deeds. or as the Messenger (pbuh) said.
  (This Hadith is sound and related by Muslim and also mentioned in Mo'jam Al-Tabrani Al-Kabir)</p>

<h6><strong>Superiority of Fear of Allah</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(17)</strong> Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri. He quoted the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) as saying to
  his companions that: a man from among the early people or from those before you had said a word, i.e.
  Allah had blessed him with wealth and sons. When death approached him, he asked his sons: How was I
  being as a father? They replied: You were the best father. He said: I didn't save or perform any good
  deeds for Allah. If Allah takes possession of me, He will punish me. So, look! when I am dead, burn me
  until I become coal then crush me well and scatter (my ashes in the air) on a storming day.
  The Prophet (pbuh) said: He took a covenant from his sons (and died). They did according to his will
  and spread his ashes in the air on a stormy day. Allah said: Be and there he was embodied before Him.
  Allah, the Exalted. asked him: O my slave! what induced you to do what you did. He replied:
  It was your fear (so that I may not appear before you). The Prophet (pbuh) added: Allah, the Exalted
  rewarded him with His Mercy; the Prophet (pbuh) said second time: Allah did not punish him.(This Hadith
  is sound and related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</p>

<h6><strong>Superiority of Dhikr (remembrance) and becoming close to Allah by way of righteous deeds and good faith in Him</strong><h6>
<p><strong>(18)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira said: The Prophet (pbuh) said: Allah (sw) says: I am in accordance
  with the thoughts of My slave about Me; and I am with him, when he remembers Me. If he remembers Me in his heart,
  I also remember him in My heart. If he remembers Me in a group, I remember him in a better group (i.e. angels).
  If he draws near Me by the span of a palm, I draw near him by a cubit. If he draws near Me by a cubit,
  I draw near him by the space covered by two hands. If he walks towards Me, I go to him running.
  (This Hadith is sound and related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</p>

<p><strong>(19)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira ( that the Prophet (pbuh) stated: Allah (sw) observed: I am with My
  slave when he remembers me and moves his lips (with remembrance).(This Hadith is sound and related in Musnad of
  Ahmad).</p>

<p><strong>(20)</strong>(One day) Abu Huraira and Abu sa'id were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (sw) who said:
  When a slave says: i.e. There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Most-Great. Allah remarks: My slave has spoken
  the truth. Indeed, there is no god except Me and I am All-Great. When he says: There is no god but Allah and He is
  the only One. Allah remarks: My slave has spoken the truth. Indeed, there is no god except Me and I am the One.
  When he says: There is no god but Allah and there is no associate with Him. Allah remarks: My slave has spoken
  the truth. There is no god except Me and I have no partner. When he says: There is no god but Allah.
  To Him belongs the sovereignty and To Him is due all praise. Allah remarks: My slave has spoken the truth.
  There is no god except Me. To Me belongs the kingdom and To Me is due all praise. When he says: There is no
  god but Allah and there is no power or might except with Him). Allah remarks: My slave has spoken the truth.
  There is no god except Me and the power and might belongs to Me.
(Its chain of authorities is sound and related by the Majah, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban).</p>

<h6><strong>Superiority of the company of pious people</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(21)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger(pbuh) said: Allah has some angels who roam
  about the streets in search of people mentioning Allah's names. When they find such a gathering, they call
  one another saying: Come to the object of your pursuit. The Prophet added: The angels surround them with their
  wings up to the lowest heaven (sky of the world). He further added: (When the people in the gathering disperse,
  the angels ascend to the heaven). Their Lord, who knows best about the people, asks them: What do my slaves say?
  The angels reply: They were glorifying You (by repeating the words "Allah is the All-Glorified), exalting You
  (by repeating the words "Allah is All-Great"), praising You (by repeating the words All praise be to Allah),
  and dignifying You. He asks them: Have they seen Me? The angels reply: No, By Allah. O Lord! They haven't seen
  You (at all). He asks: How would it be if they saw Me? The angels reply: If they saw You, they would worship
  You more devotedly, dignify You more fervently and exalt You more sincerely. Then Allah asks them: What do
  they ask Me? The angels reply: They ask You Paradise. He asks them: Have they seen it? The angels reply: No,
  By Allah, They have not seen it. He asks: How would it be, if they saw it? The angels reply: If they saw it, they
  would crave for it eagerly, seek after it vigorously and desire for it ardently. He asks: From what do they seek
  My protection? The angels reply: (They seek your protection) from the Hell-fire. He asks: Have they seen it?
  The angels reply: No, By Allah, O Lord! They haven't see it (at all). He asks: How would it be, if they saw it.
  The angels reply: If they saw it, they would fear it extremely and flee from it hastily. Then Allah says (to the
  angels): I make you witness that I have forgiven them. Allah's Messenger (pbuh) added: One of the angels would say:
  O Lord! among them was so and so (a much sinning slave) who was not actually included in the gathering but he
  happened to came there for some need (and sat down with them.) Allah would remark: Anyhow, they were all sitting
  together, so their companion will not be reduced to misery (i.e. they were sitting together and glorifying Allah,
  so he who sits with them will not suffer but get forgiveness as a reward for his (association with the people
  remembering Allah).(This Hadith is sound and related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</p>

<h6><strong>Continuous inducement for repentance and seeking Allah's forgiveness</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(22)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) saying that: a sin was
  committed by one of the slaves or may be he said, that: one of the slaves committed a sin. He said: O my Lord!
  I have committed a sin, or he said, a sin was committed by me. So please forgive. His Lord would say: Does my
  slave know that he has a Lord who can forgive him and (if He likes) can punish him. Anyhow, I have forgiven my
  slave. No sooner does the time elapse as much as Allah wishes, than is another sin committed by him or he commits
  another sin. He says: O my Lord! I have committed a sin, or a sin was committed by me. So please forgive it.
  Allah will observe: Does my slave know that he has a Lord who can forgive him and (if He likes) can punish him too.
  Anyhow, I have forgiven him again. No sooner does the time elapse as much as Allah wishes, than another sin
  committed by him or he commits another sin. He says: O my Lord! I have committed a another sin, or sometimes he
  says another sin is committed by me. So please forgive it. Allah will remark: Does my slave know that he has a Lord
  who can forgive him and (if He likes) can punish him too. Anyhow, I have forgiven him for the third time.
  So let him do whatever he wishes.(This Hadith is sound and related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</p>

  <p><strong>(23)</strong> Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri: I heard the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) saying: The devil said to
     his Lord: By Your Glory and Majesty! As long as the progeny of Adam exists on earth, I shall continuously
     misguide them. At this Allah remarked: By My Glory and Majesty! As long as they seek My forgiveness, I will
     go on to pardon them.(This Hadith is sound and related by Ahmad in his Musnad).</p>

<h6><strong>He who loves to meet Allah (sw)by way of death like martyrs) Allah too loves to meet him</strong><h6>
<p><strong>(24)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said that Allah, the Exalted, observed:
  If My slave loves meeting Me, I too love meeting him. If he dislikes to meet Me, I too hate to meet him.
(This Hadith is sound and related by Al-Bukhari and An-Nasa'i).</p>

<h6><Strong>Sign of Allah's love for His slave</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(25)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira that Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said: When Allah loves a person,
  He calls Jibrael and says (to him): I love so and so, therefore you should also love him. The Prophet (pbuh)
  added: So, Jibrael begins to love him. Then he makes an announcement in the heaven saying: Allah loves so and
  so, therefore you should also love him. Then the inhabitants of heaven (the angels) would love him. He (pbuh)
  added: Thus acceptance is established for him on earth (i.e. that person becomes popular among the people).
  When Allah dislikes any slave He calls Jibrael and says to him: I hate so and so, therefore you should also
  hate him. Then he calls out to the inhabitants of heaven: Allah hates so and so, therefore you should also
  hate him. Thus hatred is established for him on earth. (i.e. then hatred prevails against him among the people).
  (This Hadith is sound and related by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi).</p>


<h6><strong>Exhortation for developing mutual love and mercy among the Muslims</strong></h6>
 <p><strong>(26)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira that Allah's Messenger (pbuh) said: Indeed Allah (sw) would
   say on the Day of Resurrection: O son of Adam! I fell ill but you visited Me not. He will say:
   How could I visit You while You are the Lord of the worlds? Allah will say: Did you not know that
   My slave so and so was sick but you visited him not? Did you not know that if you had visited him,
   you would have found Me by him? O son of Adam! I asked you for food but you fed Me not. The slave will say:
   O Lord! How could I feed You whereas You are the Lord of the worlds? Allah will say: Do you not know that such
   and such slave of Mine asked you for food but you did not feed him. Did you not know that if you had fed him,
   you would surely have found that with Me. O son of Adam! I asked you to give Me a drink but you gave Me not a drink.
   The slave will say: O Lord! How should I give You a drink while You are the Lord of the worlds? Allah will say:
   My slave so and so asked you to give him a drink but you gave him no drink. Had you provided him a drink,
   you would have surely found the reward for doing so with Me.(This Hadith is sound and related by Muslim.)</P>

<h6><strong>Allah screens the believer in the world as well as in the Hereafter</strong></h6>
<p><strong>(27)</strong> Narrated Safwan bin Mobraz Al-Mazan: While I was on my way along with Ibn 'Umar
  ( taking (holding up) his hand in mine. Suddenly a man appeared to him and said: What did you hear
  Allah's Messenger (pbuh) saying about confidential talk (secret conversation)? He said: I heard Allah's
  Messenger (pbuh) saying: (On the Day of Resurrection) Allah will draw near to a believer and put His forgiveness
  over him and screen him (his sins) then Allah will say: Do you know such and such sin? Do you know such and such?
  He will say: Yes, my Lord! This conversation will continue) until Allah will make him confess his sins, and
  thinks that he is ruined. Then Allah will say: I concealed them (your sins in the world) and I do forgive you
  today. Then he will be given the record book containing his good deeds. As regards, the infidels and hypocrites,
  the witnesses will say: These are the people who have disbelieved their Lord. Behold! Allah's Curse is upon
  transgressors (wrong doers).(This Hadith is sound and related by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Majah)</p>

<h6><strong>Superiority of the believer</strong><h6>

<h6><strong>Some attributes of the Inhabitants of Paradise and Hell</strong></h6>

  speech: Behold! Indeed Allah has commanded me to inform you of what you are unfamiliar with; and what He has
  taught me today: Every wealth, I have conferred upon a slave is lawful. Indeed I have created My slaves being true
  in faith; but the satans approached them and turned them away from their religion and what had been permissible
  declared as forbidden for them. Further the satans ordered them to make partners with me for which I have revealed
  no evidence. Verily, Allah looked at the people on earth and hated both Arabs and non-Arabs - except a few people
  of the Scripture. Allah added: I have sent you as a Prophet to the people so that I may test you and test the
  believers through you and revealed to you a book that water cannot erase. So you should read it while asleep
  and awake. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Indeed Allah has ordered me to burn (the disbelievers of) Quresh,
  (the Prophet's tribe of Mecca) So I said: O Lord! They would crush my head like bread. Allah said: Drive them
  out as they drove you out of your city. Fight them, We shall support you. Spend (money in the cause of Allah),
  We will spend on you. Send an army, We will send five like that. Fight with your followers against those who deny
  you. He said: The inhabitants of Paradise are three kinds of people: First is a powerful, just, almsgiver, and a
  successful man. second is a kind, tender-hearted man towards every relative and Muslim. Third is a decent father
  to many children. He also said: Dwellers of Hell are five types: First is a weak-follower man who has no sense to
  avoid the evil or work for family or wealth. Second is a dishonest man whose greed is well known to people,
  even for minor things. Third is a man who will betray you about your family and wealth at both the ends of the day.
  He also mentioned a miser or a liar and a person who uses bad words.(This Hadith is sound and related by Muslim.)</p>


<p><strong>(45)</strong> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (pbuh) said: Once Paradise and Hell argued with one
  another. Hell said: I have been given preference by the oppressors and tyrants. Paradise said: What is the matter
  with me that only weak and humble people enter me. Allah Sa'id to the paradise: You are My mercy. I will bestow
  mercy through you on whom I wish from among My slaves. And He said to Hell: Rather you are My torment.
  I will torment by you whom I wish from among My slaves. The Prophet (pbuh) added: Each of them will take its
  capacity. As for Hell, it will not be filled until Allah puts down His glorified foot in it. Then it will say:
  Enough! Enough! Enough! at that time all its parts will be filled up. Allah will not treat unjustly any one of His
  creation. As regards Paradise, Allah will create other creations to fill it. (Being All-Merciful)

  So they will dip him once in it. Then Allah will ask him: Did you ever face any distress or a thing you hate.
  He would say: No, By Your Glory! Never did I face anything unpleasant. Then one of the most affluent people
  of the world will be brought from Hell. Allah will command (the angels:) Dip him once in it. Then He will ask him:
  O son of Adam! Did you ever enjoy any comfort? (that is, a dip in hell can make one forget the meaning of comfort.)

  Adam will ask: Who are the people doomed to Hell? Allah will say: They are nine hundred and ninety nine out of
  every one thousand. The Prophet (pbuh) said: At this juncture every child would turn gray-haired and every pregnant
  would miscarry due to the dread of the moment and you would see people as drunk while they would not actually be.
  The torment of Allah would be grievous enough to make them so. Then the companions asked: O Allah's Messenger
  (pbuh) ! Who would be that single person among us? He said: Be happy! When one is selected for Paradise) from
  among you, one thousand from Gog and Magog would be sent to Hell. Then he said: By Him in whose hand is my soul!
  I hope you will constitute one fourth of the inhabitants of Paradise. We exclaimed.(Allah is All-Great) He said:
  I anticipate you would be one third of the people of Paradise. again we shouted. He said: I expect you would be
  half of the people of Paradise. Again we exclaimed. He further said: Despite, You would be just like a black
  hair in the skin of a white ox or like a white hair in the skin of a black one .(i.e. your number compared with

  in seeing the Sun at noon when it is not cloudy. They said: No. He further said: Do you feel any difficulty in
  seeing the Moon at the night of full moon when there is no cloud. They said: No. Thereupon he said: By Him who
  holds my life! You will not face any difficulty in seeing Allah as much as seeing one of them. The Prophet (pbuh)
  added: Then Allah would sit for judgment upon the slaves and would say: O so and so! Did I not honor you and make
  you chief and provide you a spouse and subdue for you horses and camels and offered you an opportunity to rule over
  your subjects and take one fourth of booty. The slave would say, Yes. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Allah would say:
  Did you not think that you would meet me? He would say: No. Thereupon, Allah would say: I overlook you today as
  you forgot me. Then the second person will be brought (for judgment). Allah would say: O so and so! Did I not honor
  you and make you the chief and make you a pair and subdue for you horses and camels and offered you an opportunity
  to rule over your subjects and take one fourth of booty. He would say: Yes, my Lord! Then he would say: Did you not
   think that you would meet Me. The slave would say: No. At this moment Allah would say: Well, I overlook you today
   as you forgot Me. Then the third one would be brought for judgment. Allah would ask him the same thing. At this,
   the slave would say: O. my Lord! I believed in You and Your Book and Your apostles. Also, I performed prayers,
   observed fast and gave charity. Then he would speak in good terms like this. Allah would say: Well;. The Prophet
   (pbuh) added: Then, it would be said to him: Now, we will bring our witnesses to you. Then man will think: Who
   will bear witness upon me. Then, his mouth would be sealed and it would be said to his thighs, flesh and bones:
   Speak. So his thighs, flesh and bones would bear witness to his deeds. This is because he will not be able to make
   any excuse for himself. He would be a hypocrite whom Allah would be angry with.

   The Prophet (pbuh) )added: Then the slave would say: Today I do not allow any witness against me except a witness
   of my own self. Then the Prophet (pbuh) said: Allah would say: Today only yourself and the noble recording angels
    would be witnesses to you. Then the Prophet (pbuh) ) said: Then his mouth would be sealed and it would be said to

chest unfulfilled. Allah says to whom He likes from among the angels: Go to them and greet them. The angels say:
We are inhabitants of Your heaven and are the choicest of Your creation and still You want us to go and offer
greetings to them? Allah says: Indeed they are the slaves who worship Me alone and associate none with Me
(in any form of worship). Through them the boundaries are guarded and calamities are prevented. When anyone
of them is dead, his wish remains in his chest unfulfilled. He said: So the angels will come to them and enter
