          <li>The rules of Jihad are very strict, lives or property of non-Muslims are not allowed to be put                            in danger, Islam ensures to protect the non-Muslim minorities, their lives and estates as
              equally as it provides these assurance for Muslims.</li>
          <li>Islam does not allow the Muslims to live in a state of oppression, in the event of which it                                requires them to migrate to another land, and not to risk trouble there. Islam does not
              encourage tension in land in any form.</li>
