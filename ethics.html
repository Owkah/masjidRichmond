  <h4><strong>Code of Ethics:</strong></h4>
  <p>Islam is a religion which does not encourage its believers to restrict themselves to a
     spiritual phase but covers all the worldly affairs and provides them a code of ethics, so
     that a good society could be nurtured where all human beings become sympathetic to each other.
     Islam allows no distinction between Mosque and worldy affairs, and suggests a code that covers
     all walks of life.</p>
     The Prophet of Islam led a life full of wisdom, justice, modesty, bravery and compassion.
     The first Caliph of Islam, Abu Bakr (RA) represented the Prophet's wisdom,
     the second Caliph of Islam, Umar (RA) was distinct in his rule of justice, the third Caliph,
     Uthman (RA) represented the Prophet's modesty and the fourth Caliph Ali (RA) was distinct in his bravery.<br>
     Akhlaq Jalali is an authentic book on Islamic Ethics and it mentions these four characters of ethics.
     The collective approach to these points provides a sense of direction in this field.</p><br>

    <h4><strong>Code of Life:</strong></h4>
    <p>Human life is divided different aspects, these can be categorized as personal, family, social and state.
       In the personal aspect the believer has to abide by the tenets of Islam and this is also reflected in
       the responsibility to the family through marriage and respect for parents. The social aspects place
       responsibility on the believer to take care of the social needs of their community, form an attachment
       to a mosque, and participate in the affairs of the Ummah as a global entity. This entails knowing that the
       believers are members of the community of Muhammad (PBUH) which is scattered all over the world each and
       every believer has a duty to be consciuous of what is happening to the Ummah and to make all efforts to
       safeguard and protect it and its interests.</p><br>

      <h4><strong>Code of Earning:</strong></h4><br>
      <p>Money circulates within the society. In Islam certain methods of attaining money and assets of wealth are
        not allowed. Money can be earned through either labor or business, provided that the business is a lawful.
        An individual can also obtain wealth through inheritance, money or assets from parents or other relatives.
        Giving money or material things as gifts is allowed. Money can also be given to the poor and needy as charity.
         But money cannot be acquired riding on money from others or by way of theft. Robbery deceiving and gambling
         are not allowed. benefit on mortgaged things (houses and shops) is also forbidden</p><br>
