  <h4><strong>General Information about Islam</strong></h4>
  <p>The literal meaning of Islam is peace; surrender of one's will i.e. losing oneself for the sake of God and surrendering
     one's own pleasure for the pleasure of God. The message of Islam was revealed to the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings on him)
     1, 400 years ago. It was revealed through angel Gabriel (on whom be peace) and was thus preserved in the Holy Quran. The Holy Quran carries
     a Divine guarantee of safeguard from interpolation and it claims that it combines the best features of the earlier scriptures.</p>

  <p>The prime message of Islam is the Unity of God, that the Creator of the world is One and He alone is worthy of worship and that Muhammad
     (peace and blessings on him) is His Messenger and Servant. The follower of this belief is thus a Muslim - a Muslim's other beliefs are:
     God's angels, previously revealed Books of God, all the prophets, from Adam to Jesus (peace be on them both), the Day of Judgement and
     indeed the Decree of God. A Muslim has five main duties to perform, namely; bearing witness to the Unity of God and Muhammad (peace and
     blessings on him) as His Messenger, observing the prescribed prayer, payment of Zakat, keeping the fasts of Ramadhan and performing the
     pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>

  <p>Islam believes that each person is born pure. The Holy Quran tells us that God has given human beings a choice between good and evil and
    to seek God's pleasure through faith, prayer and charity. Islam believes that God created mankind in His image and by imbuing the attributes
    of God on a human level mankind can attain His nearness. Islam's main message is to worship God and to treat all God's creation with kindness
    and compassion. Rights of parents in old age, orphans and the needy are clearly stated. Women's rights were safeguarded 1,400 years ago when the
    rest of the world was in total darkness about emancipation. Islamic teachings encompass every imaginable situation and its rules and principles
    are truly universal and have stood the test of time. In Islam virtue does not connote forsaking the bounties of nature that are lawful. On the
    contrary one is encouraged to lead a healthy, active life with the qualities of kindness, chastity, honesty, mercy, courage patience and politeness.
     In short, Islam has a perfect and complete code for the guidance of individuals and communities alike. As the entire message of Islam is derived
     from the Holy Quran and indeed the Sunnah and Hadith (the traditions and practices of the Holy Prophet, peace and blessings on him) it is
     immutable in the face of change in time and place. It may appear rigid to the casual eye, in actual fact it is most certainly an adaptable way
     of life regardless of human changes.</p>

   <p>Islam teaches that the path to spiritual development is open to all. Any individual who searches the One Creator can seek nearness to God
     through sincere and earnest worship; it is central to establishing a relationship with the Almighty. This positive message for humanity fills
     hearts with hope and courage. At present there are 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide and they form the majority in more than 50 countries of the
     world. Today Islam is the fastest growing faith in the world - its beautiful message is reaching millions in the far corner of the earth.</p>
