    <h4><strong>Code of Life:</strong></h4>
    <p>Human life is divided different aspects, these can be categorized as personal, family, social and state.
       In the personal aspect the believer has to abide by the tenets of Islam and this is also reflected in
       the responsibility to the family through marriage and respect for parents. The social aspects place
       responsibility on the believer to take care of the social needs of their community, form an attachment
       to a mosque, and participate in the affairs of the Ummah as a global entity. This entails knowing that the
       believers are members of the community of Muhammad (PBUH) which is scattered all over the world each and
       every believer has a duty to be consciuous of what is happening to the Ummah and to make all efforts to
       safeguard and protect it and its interests.</p><br>
